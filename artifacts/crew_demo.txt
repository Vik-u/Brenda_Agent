**What the data tell us (and what they don’t)**  
- **Enzyme identity & role**  
  - EC 2.1.1.247 is the *methyl‑CoIII methylamine‑specific corrinoid protein‑coenzyme M methyltransferase* (often abbreviated MtmB).  
  - It catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methylamine (or methyl‑substituted amines) to coenzyme M (CoM) via a corrinoid protein (CoFeSP).  This step is essential in the methyl‑amine branch of methanogenesis in methanogenic archaea such as *Methanosarcina* spp. and *Methanomethylovorans* spp.  
  - The reaction proceeds through a two‑step mechanism: (1) methyl‑amine → methyl‑corrinoid protein (CoIII → CoIV) and (2) methyl‑corrinoid protein → methyl‑CoM + reduced corrinoid protein.  

- **Substrates & cofactors**  
  - Primary substrate: methylamine (CH₃NH₂).  
  - Cofactors: CoFeSP (corrinoid protein), coenzyme M (HSCoM), and a reduced form of the corrinoid protein (CoI).  
  - The enzyme is metal‑dependent; the active site contains a metal ion (often Zn²⁺ or Fe²⁺) that is chelated by the corrinoid prosthetic group.  

- **Inhibitors**  
  - The only inhibitor captured in the wild‑type dataset is **EDTA**.  EDTA is a strong metal chelator, so its inhibition likely reflects removal of the essential metal ion from the active site.  
  - No other small‑molecule inhibitors (e.g., analogues of methylamine, competitive inhibitors, or allosteric modulators) have been reported in the current dataset.  

- **Kinetics**  
  - Six distinct Km entries exist for this EC number, indicating that kinetic studies have been performed in multiple laboratories.  Unfortunately, the numeric values were not retrieved in this query.  
  - No kcat (turnover number) data are available for the wild‑type enzyme.  This means we lack a measure of catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) and cannot compare the enzyme’s performance to related methyltransferases.  

- **Missing data & gaps**  
  1. **Numeric Km values** – We need the actual µM or mM values to assess substrate affinity.  
  2. **kcat / Vmax** – Without turnover numbers, we cannot evaluate catalytic power or compare mutants.  
  3. **pH and temperature optima** – These parameters are essential for designing in‑vitro assays.  
  4. **Effect of metal ions** – While EDTA inhibition suggests metal dependence, the identity and stoichiometry of the metal ion(s) remain unclear.  
  5. **Mutational data** – No information on site‑directed mutants (e.g., active‑site residues, metal‑binding motifs) is available.  
  6. **Inhibitor spectrum** – Other potential inhibitors (e.g., methyl‑amine analogues, transition‑state analogues) have not been tested or reported.  

**Practical take‑aways for a biochemist**  
- **If you want to characterize the enzyme’s catalytic properties**, you’ll need to obtain the missing kinetic parameters.  A standard approach is to purify the wild‑type enzyme (or express it recombinantly) and perform steady‑state kinetics with varying methylamine concentrations, measuring the formation of methyl‑CoM (e.g., by HPLC or LC‑MS).  
- **To confirm metal dependence**, re‑introduce specific metal ions (Zn²⁺, Fe²⁺, Co²⁺) after EDTA treatment and assess activity recovery.  Metal‑specific chelators (e.g., TPEN for Zn²⁺) can help pinpoint the essential metal.  
- **To explore inhibitor space**, test a panel of methyl‑amine analogues (e.g., dimethylamine, trimethylamine) and potential transition‑state analogues.  This will reveal whether the enzyme is selective for primary amines or can accept secondary/tertiary amines.  
- **To probe the active site**, design site‑directed mutants of residues that coordinate the corrinoid or the metal ion (e.g., histidines, cysteines).  Measure how these mutations affect Km and kcat to map the catalytic mechanism.  

**Suggested next experiment**  
1. **Retrieve the numeric Km values**:  
   - Run a targeted query against the `enzyme_facts` table (or use `brenda_sql_lookup`) to pull the exact Km numbers for EC 2.1.1.247.  
2. **Measure kcat**:  
   - Perform a time‑course assay with saturating methylamine and measure product formation to calculate kcat.  
3. **Metal re‑constitution**:  
   - After EDTA treatment, add back Zn²⁺ or Fe²⁺ and monitor activity recovery to confirm the metal requirement.  

These steps will fill the most critical data gaps, allowing you to compare the wild‑type enzyme’s performance to engineered variants and to other methyltransferases in the methanogenesis pathway.
